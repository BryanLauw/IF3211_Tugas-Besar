        <h1>Input by Genotype</h1>
        <p>This outlines the process your data goes through after submission:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Gene Identification:</strong> Each gene you input is first searched using the JAX Ontology API to retrieve its unique JAX Gene ID. This is done via: <br /><code class="api-endpoint"
                        >https://ontology.jax.org/api/network/search/gene?q=[your_gene_name]&amp;limit=1</code
                    >
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>2. Gene Annotation Retrieval:</strong> The JAX Gene ID obtained in the previous step is then used to fetch detailed gene annotations from the JAX API. This includes a list of diseases associated with that gene,
                    using the endpoint: <br /><code class="api-endpoint">https://ontology.jax.org/api/network/annotation/[JAX_gene_id]</code>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>3. Phenotype Matching & OMIM ID Extraction:</strong> The system reviews the list of diseases associated with the gene. For each disease that is an OMIM entry and its name matches one of the phenotypes you
                    provided, its specific OMIM ID is identified.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>4. OMIM Annotation & Inheritance Details:</strong> Each identified OMIM ID is then used to query the JAX API again. This call retrieves detailed OMIM annotations, crucially including the inheritance pattern for
                    that specific disease/phenotype, from: <br /><code class="api-endpoint">https://ontology.jax.org/api/network/annotation/[OMIM_ID]</code>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>5. Inheritance Category Identification:</strong> From the OMIM annotation details, the system extracts the inheritance category for the matched disease (e.g., Autosomal Dominant, Autosomal Recessive, X-linked
                    Dominant, X-linked Recessive, or Y-linked).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>6. Risk Calculation:</strong> Finally, the potential inheritance risk for offspring is calculated. This calculation uses the identified inheritance pattern and the parental zygosities you entered, applying
                    principles similar to a Punnett square.
